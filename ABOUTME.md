- 👋 Hi, I’m @OctavianLupus 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how the cloud computing works and integrate that knowledge with my diary workflow. I do love to exercise some HTML studies to produce some web pages, create creatives designs and have fun programming! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT infrastructure management, cloud computing, client suport, VMs creations and management.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a place that evolve the employees with parallel studies based on the workflow of the company, have a respectful team and a light 
- day-to-day activities.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me with my Linkedin account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/otavio-augusto-ab0938164/ and my Twitter: https://twitter.com/augmotta
